The code in this repository (run from the driveGenAlgTest.m script) performs a series of tests comparing upscaled solutions to full-network solutions for several synthetic networks generated with CPlantBox (https://github.com/Plant-Root-Soil-Interactions-Modelling/CPlantBox). The code currently runs without error on all testing examples included here. 

Further generality and efficiency issues are noted in the issues section of the repository. It can be shown theoretically that all known generality issues can be overcome. The algorithm can be beta-tested (or used) on root systems not included in the test set (formated as vtp outputs from CPlantBox) from the driveRSAUpsc.m script. 

Comments, requests, and use in beta-testing mode is welcome; please contact the author at martin.bouda@ibot.cas.cz with any queries.
