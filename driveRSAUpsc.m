tol=1e-5;  %relative tolerance for soft check
    %for fully determined systems, can do tol=1e-12
    %for overdetermined, get c close to 0, need tol=1e-5
    %regardless, residuals on actual predictions are double-precision roundoffs
    %system 9 fails softtest because of the overdetermined numerical
    %solution shape, not because of the upscaling algorithm; residuals OK
resTol=1e-12; %relative tolerance on numerical residuals; 
    %needed for cases where numerical estimation of coefficients rank
    %deficient...
    %have now registered some cases of residuals ~3e-12, so fails but fine,
    %soft-test is passed in these cases; all pass if re-run: due to random
    %variation in parameters.

    %in Pisum sativum 13-day, j=5: fails significantly on residuals
    %if there is a bug, it appears to be in compLayerEqs, before line 178
    
    %target link (25)  is very short, but lengthening it by brute force
    %does not right the errors
    
    %the residuals are also not due to brute number of links in subdomain
        %layer 5 has same number of links in solution subdomain as layers
        %2-4; layers 6-7 have more and layer 8 has even more. 
        
    %does not seem to be due to differences in magnitude of the coeffs or
    %their number (i.e. reduction of system)
        
    %so it must be due to activation of different code. 
        %some subset of code:
            %(a) contains a bug, or 
            %(b) is especially prone to propagating num. error
    %how can we track differential code activations?
    
    %seems that downward substitution increases the residuals; layers lower
    %down in identical subdomains have more error
        %in layer 5 affects coeff for psi125 in eqs for psiX4 or psiX5 (or both)
        
    %may be due to extra layerEqs chosen with huge and/or
    %tiny coefs, which make many coefs <1e-16 upon substitution,
    %which then gets them truncated
    
    %actually: truncateCoeffs eliminates coeffs 1e-16 times smaller than
    %largest coef across all equations...
    %as soon as there is a crazy equation with giant coef, it all goes
    %batshit.
